# My AI Usage

## Overview
I used Claude AI as a development assistant throughout this project.
While AI provided helpful suggestions, references, and examples, I maintained **full control over architecture, logic, and implementation decisions**. All final code, structure, and behavior were written, reviewed, and understood by me.

## AI Tools Used
The AI tools I used:
  - **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**
    - Platform: Claude.ai
    - Used for code suggestions, documentation wording, debugging ideas, and test scaffolding examples

## Detailed Breakdown
### Backend (≈30% AI, 70% Me)

**AI Helped With:**
- Example JWT authentication patterns (reference only)
- SQLAlchemy model and repository templates
- FastAPI dependency injection examples
- Error-handling and response model suggestions
- Writing and refining **30+ backend tests** (TDD approach)
- Naming conventions and documentation clarity

**I Did Myself:**
- Initial FastAPI project structure
- Database schema design and migrations
- All business logic implementation
- Custom validation rules and edge-case handling
- Query optimization and filtering logic
- Authentication and authorization flow design
- Security configurations and environment setup
- Docker configuration and service orchestration
- Debugging runtime issues and API errors

### Frontend (≈25% AI, 75% Me)
**AI Helped With:**
- React component structure examples
- Tailwind CSS utility class suggestions
- Accessibility reminders and best practices
- Writing and refining **100+ frontend tests** (TDD approach)
- Debugging form validation and API integration issues

**I Did Myself:**
- TypeScript type definitions and strict typing
- Complete UI/UX design decisions
- Component architecture and reusability
- State management and data flow
- Form validation and sanitization logic
- API integration and error handling
- Search, filtering, and pagination behavior
- User flows and interactions
- Performance and usability improvements

### What AI Built?

**AI Assistance (~80%):**
- README structure template
- Formatting and wording suggestions
- Documentation clarity improvements

### What I Built 100% Myself**
- Overall system architecture
- Database schema and relationships
- API endpoint behavior and business rules
- Authentication and authorization logic
- Frontend UI/UX design and layout
- Search, filtering, and validation logic
- Docker and deployment setup
- Testing strategy and coverage decisions
- Debugging, optimization, and refactoring

### Honesty Statement
I can explain **every part of this codebase** in detail.
AI was used strictly as a **reference and productivity tool**, similar to documentation or Stack Overflow.
All architectural decisions, logic, and final implementations are my own.
